# NextWordPredictor
A program aimed in the prediction of the next word based on the user's input.

With the use of the nltk's brown corpus as training data, once adequately preprocessed, the program creates bigrams as the base for the prediction of possible next words which are most probable to be chosen by users. They are given possibilities and in case their needs are not met, users may type their own word.
